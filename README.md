# A-Deep-Learning-Based-QA-Bot-Using-BERT
Project for CS7643:
Tommy Jiang, Nicole Ye, Mark Luo

1. Dataset: 
Download the dataset (Training set V2.0 and Dev Set v2.0) from:https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/
and unzip the file, put them in the Data folder within the root directory with the python notebook and other code files.

2. Setup:
Prediction, evaluation and visualization: run notebook BERT_QA_bot_v5.ipynb
Platform: We run the notebook on Google Colab pro with 16G of GPU and 25G of RAM. If run locally, path need to be change accoridingly.
The experimented models are located in models.py, we experiment with these models in the BERT_QA_bot_v5.ipynb by calling each model.
